Magic: The Gathering and Dice Masters
collection data source scripts for Tellico
https://github.com/tomaszg7/tellico_stuff
--------------------------------------------------

The Magic the Gathering script grabs information from http://gatherer.wizards.com. It is rather ugly regexp job since the Gatherer doesn't support 
(as far as I know it) any API. So, it is sure to break in the future when they change the layout of their webpage (or even refactor their html).

Right now it supports searching the online database by card name, artist name and "multiverse id".
It grabs all data I could think of (including card image) and stores it in collection.
If you can't find a card by name, you can try to locate it on-line and add to collection using its Gatherer id (multiverse id).
You can also make decks using Tellico's loan feature.

Requirements:
-------------
1. Perl
2. Getopt::Std, File::Fetch, MIME::Base64, File::Copy, Storable Perl modules
3. (optional) Archive::Zip for some helper scripts

Installation:
-------------
Put the file mtg2.pl in Tellico datasource directory (or anywhere else) and mtg.pm where Perl can find it. You can check @INC paths via:

perl -e "print @INC"

You need to add a new datasource for "Custom Collection" configuring Tellico (see screenshot: http://tomaszg.pl/tellico-mtg/config.jpg):

1. Collection type: Custom
2. Result type: Tellico
3. Check:
	"Title": -n %1
	"Person": -a %1
	"arXiv id": -N %1
	"Update": -N %{multiverseid}

I don't think it's possible to make arbitrary labels for search fields, so "title" means card's name, "person" means artist and "arxiv id" denotes Gatherer's "multiverse id".

Create empty collection of "custom" type and just use datasource to look for the cards. It prints out only 10 first results, so you might need 
to search some by multiverse id.

The scripts caches search results and images in ~/.cache/mtg-perl

Helper scripts:
---------------
mtg-braki.pl - reads Tellico database files and prints out missing cards for a given expansion(s) and/or some stats
mtg-check-pseudo.pl - reads Tellico database and checks if there are some "pseudocards" listed there. At the moment it only looks for melded cards and reverse sides (listed by hand in mtg_pseudo.pm)
mtg-set.pl - generates a Tellico database containing whole expansion

Scripts have hardcoded locations of input/output files, so they might need hand-tuning.
